## OAuth 2.0

[RFC 6749 - The OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework - IETF Tools](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749)

*  The OAuth 2.0 authorization framework enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf.

---

## Roles

### resource owner

*  An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource. When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an end-user.


### resource server

* The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

---

## Roles 

### client

* An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization. The term "client" does not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g., whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other devices).

### authorization server

* The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.
